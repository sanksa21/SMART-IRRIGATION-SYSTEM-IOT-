# SMART-IRRIGATION-SYSTEM-IOT BASED:
SMART IRRIGATION SYSTEM USING ARDUINO IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE MOISTURE CONTENT IN AGRICULTURAL FIELD

Smart irrigation system using Arduino is one among those system.
It is an automatic watering system made using Arduino micro-controller to control and sense the moisture in the soil using soil moisture
sensor in order to calculate and calibrate the amount of water 
needed by the crops in different climatic conditions such that water is irreverently wasted. 
In this system the soil moisture sensor senses the level of moisture in the soil, according to the data 
collected if the soil is found to be 
dried then the sensor senses the moisture level as low and thus automatically the switches the water pump for a reverent period of time.
At this moment of time for each time band the data is stored and checked as when the plant gets sufficient water and when the soil
gets sufficiently wet the sensor is able to sense that there is enough moisture 
in the soil and turns off the water pump automatically.

COMPONENTS:
1. ARDUINO
2. MOISTURE SENSOR
